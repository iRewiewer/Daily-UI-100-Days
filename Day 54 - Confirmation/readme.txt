Prompt: Confirmation

Design a Confirmation UI element.
What's being confirmed? Is it confirming an address, order, shipping, plane tickets,
hotel reservation, dinner reservation, booking tickets to the opera, or something else?
Also consider where it's occurring (i.e. website, mobile app, email confirmation, etc.)
