Prompt: Onboarding

Are you recruiting people for an organization? Are people signing up for a new service or website? Is it welcoming people into a mobile app? 
 
Onboarding might seem trivial, but it's the first experience your users have with your product or service. It's like the first page of a book and it can instantly excite them. If not implemented well, a bad onboarding experience could turn someone off of a brand completely.
