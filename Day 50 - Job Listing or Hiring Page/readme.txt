Prompt: Job Listing or Hiring Page

Who is hiring? What's the position? Where is it located? Are there benefits? 
 
Hiring pages are a great opportunity for brands to give fun facts about their team. That can help prospective employees learn something interesting that could inspire them. For example, a team page might say “We take an annual team vacation to Hawaii.”
