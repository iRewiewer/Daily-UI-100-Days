Prompt: Recipe or Food Order

Design a food related recipe. It could displayed on a tablet while someone is cooking in their home kitchen or in the back of a restaurant on a Kitchen Display System (aka KDS).
 
Clarity is important because a restaurant or online food ordering service needs to be simple in order to be fast for customers to find what they want and how it can be customized. Confusing menus or recipes slow down the kitchen and the entire business.
