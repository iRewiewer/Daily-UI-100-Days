Prompt: Testimonial

Create a design with some kind of testimonial. It could be a book or product review testimonial. Who is the customer? What did they buy and why did they enjoy it? Is there a star rating or a 1-10 style review? 
 
Testimonials help build trust with an audience so these can be especially important elements for a website.
