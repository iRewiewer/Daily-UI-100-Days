Prompt: Music Player

Design a music player. It could be browser based or an app (i.e. Pandora, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) or in a standalone product like in a car dashboard, jukebox, etc.
 
Consider the controls, placements, imagery such as the artist or album cover, etc. Also, consider the device type that's playing the music. A dashboard in a tour bus, a smartwatch, or via a web browser. Each device type will have different requirements, features, and restrictions to consider.
