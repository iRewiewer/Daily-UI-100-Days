Prompt: Pricing

Is it a pricing table for a SaaS website? An in-app purchase? Or upgrade options for a restaurant menu?
 
Displaying prices in an easy-to-read format is a good design and business practice. Make the price obvious and don't try to hide anything. Overly complex pricing tables or designs create confusion and consequently a lack of trustâ€¦ bad for both business and design.
