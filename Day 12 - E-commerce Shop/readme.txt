Prompt: E-commerce Shop

Design an e-commerce shop. Is it simple for a local business or a large online retailer? Is it for clothing, shoes, handmade soap, or something else? 

Consider the brand, the products offered, product views, product options, desired actions (conversions, product views, pricing options, etc.) and of course, the users!
