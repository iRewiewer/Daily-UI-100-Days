Prompt: Redeem Coupon

Imagine that it's time for someone to redeem a coupon. 
 
It could be via an in person self-checkout screen or on a website. Think about the requirements of a coupon such as the discount percentage, the subtotal, total, and other unique features.
 
Always make it easy. The last thing people want to encounter is a complex interface that adds friction to the redemption process.
